 This project was created for genome analysis, given a source file
 of genomes (say, from a public database). Its main architecture is
 a trie (a structure with a key and a vector of children), and users
 can add, remove, and analyze genome files. It also gives percent
 matches across different genomes. Overall, this project really
 opened my eyes to the wide disciplines of computer science.
